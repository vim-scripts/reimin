*reimin.txt*  Plugin for adding #includes

Matan Nassau <matan.nassau@gmail.com>

Adding an #include in a C or C++ program is very simple: you move the cursor
somewhere near the top of the file and place your #include there. My trouble
with this is that it's annoying to jump to the top of file and then return to
where I was because it distracts my focus. The reimin plugin is therefore here
to simply allow adding an #include without moving the cursor.


:IncludeSystem                                      *reimin-add-system-include*

Add a system #include after the last #include line above the current position
of the cursor. You will be asked to enter the header to #include on the command
line.


:IncludeLocal                                        *reimin-add-local-include*

Add a local #include after the last #include line above the current position of
the cursor. You will be asked to enter the header to #include on the command
line.
